This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves the `gradlew` command failing due to incorrect configuration or dependencies.  The error message may vary but commonly indicates a problem in the Android build process.  A common cause is missing or misconfigured Android SDK components, environment variables not set correctly, or conflicting dependencies in the project's `build.gradle` files.  Another cause could be a network connectivity issue during the download of dependencies.
