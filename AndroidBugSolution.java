The solution involves several steps to diagnose and fix the root cause of the Gradle errors:

1. **Verify Android SDK Installation:** Ensure you have the latest Android SDK components installed. Use the Android Studio SDK Manager to install or update necessary packages (build tools, Android APIs, etc.).
2. **Check Environment Variables:**  Make sure `ANDROID_HOME` is correctly set to the path of your Android SDK installation.  Add the `%ANDROID_HOME%\tools` and `%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools` (or equivalent for Linux/macOS) directories to your system's PATH environment variable. Restart your terminal after making these changes.
3. **Resolve Dependency Conflicts:** Carefully examine your project's `build.gradle` files (both the app-level and project-level ones). Look for conflicting dependencies and try to resolve them.  You might need to update or exclude some dependencies, or use dependency management plugins to assist with dependency resolution.
4. **Check Network Connectivity:** Ensure you have a stable internet connection.  Gradle downloads dependencies from remote repositories, and any network interruptions can lead to errors.
5. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning and rebuilding your project using `expo prebuild` followed by `eas build --platform android`. This removes cached files that may be contributing to the problem.
6. **Examine Gradle Properties:** Check `gradle.properties` for potential issues such as proxy settings that might interfere with dependency downloads.
7. **Consider Project Structure:** Examine your project structure for issues that might affect the gradle build. Make sure that your project is set up correctly according to the Expo documentation for Android.

If the issue persists after these steps, provide the full error logs from the Gradle build to assist in further debugging.
